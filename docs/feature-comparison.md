# Feature Comparison
{: .no_toc }

{: .note }
Detailed side-by-side comparisons of Microsoft AI technologies. Use this page after you’ve clarified requirements in the [Decision Framework]({{ '/docs/decision-framework' | relative_url }}), so the tables confirm trade-offs (rather than driving the decision by brand names alone).

{: .note }
**Sanity check before you compare:** If the work is deterministic, repeatable, or can be expressed as a clear function/workflow, **don’t use an agent**—use a workflow, API integration, or traditional code. Agents are best when the task is ambiguous, multi-step, and conversational, where the steps can’t be fully specified up front.[^when-not-agent]

## Comprehensive Platform Comparison

Quick view of core platforms (M365 Copilot, Studio, Foundry, Agent Framework, Logic Apps) across UX, governance, orchestration, and hosting trade-offs.

**How to use this section:** Start with the columns that match your trust boundary and channel needs, then compare orchestration and governance features to validate whether you should stay in SaaS, step into low-code, or move to pro-code.
