## CAF Agent Adoption Quick Cues

- **Phases in one line:** Plan (business + tech + org + data), Govern & secure (responsible AI, controls, environment prep), Build (single vs multi, orchestrate, secure process), Operate (integrate, monitor, retire). [CAF AI agent adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/).
- **When not to use an agent:** Highly deterministic workflows or static Q&A/content generation → use code or plain RAG. [Business plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/business-strategy-plan).
- **SaaS vs build:** Use SaaS agents when they meet requirements; if not, prototype on Foundry or Copilot Studio before committing to custom builds. [Technology plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/technology-solutions-plan-strategy).
- **Single vs multi:** Start single; go multi-agent only for hard security/compliance boundaries, distinct owning teams, or planned modular growth. [Single vs multiple](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/single-agent-multiple-agents).
- **Prioritize use cases fast:** Score business impact, feasibility, desirability; pick high-impact, low-friction pilots first.
- **Org roles:** Platform owns guardrails, workload teams own use cases and data, AI CoE advises and standardizes. [Organizational readiness](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/organization-people-readiness-plan).
- **Build safely:** Use workflows for deterministic control, treat instructions as versioned config, gate tool calls, isolate memory per role/tenant, and run evaluations before production. [Build process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/build-secure-process).
- **Operate with evidence:** Keep an agent inventory/identity, centralize logging, track cost and quotas, red team regularly, retire unused agents. [Manage agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ai-agents/integrate-manage-operate).

## Agentic Retrieval Quick Facts

- Knowledge agents are now **knowledge bases** (Preview, `2025-11-01-preview`); routes `/knowledgebases/*`, `outputMode` + `retrievalReasoningEffort` (minimal/low/medium) replace fast path.
- Knowledge sources (Preview): indexed SharePoint, remote SharePoint (Copilot Retrieval API, ACL-trimmed), indexed OneLake, web/Bing, search index, Azure Blob; `ingestionParameters` wraps embeddings/chat models/Content Understanding; portal creates `2025-08-01-preview` objects—migrate for `2025-11-01-preview`.
- Semantic ranker is available on **free tier** (quota limits); enable on the service before using KBs.
- Hybrid/vector preview (`2024-09-01-preview`): MRL `truncationDimension`, `filterOverride` for vector-only filters, `debug` subscores for RRF, token-based Text Split parameters.
- Content Understanding skill (Preview) replaces Text Split for richer chunking; billed to Foundry resource when used via `contentExtractionMode`.

## Memory & Analytics by Technology

{: .note }
**Common Customer Confusion**: Grounding (RAG) ≠ Memory ≠ Analytics

| Technology | 📋 Grounding (RAG) | 💾 Memory / Thread Storage | 📊 Analytics / Transcripts | Admin Access | Retention Control |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **M365 Copilot** | ✅ M365 content per request | ⚠️ User-level memory[^m365-memory-qr]; user history lives in mailbox/Graph | ⚠️ Copilot activity history, Teams call summaries if policy allows | ⚠️ Purview/eDiscovery only | ✅ Purview retention policies; Teams calling policy can force "only during the call" |
| **Copilot Studio** | ✅ M365 data, Dataverse, connectors | ⚠️ Dataverse variables per conversation | ✅ Session reports, transcript downloads, ROI analytics | ✅ Transcript Viewer role required | ✅ Toggle Dataverse save, default 30-day retention, bulk delete |
| **Microsoft Foundry Agent Service** | ✅ Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB, Fabric, tools | ✅ BYO thread storage in Cosmos DB (standard setup) | ⚠️ Custom telemetry (App Insights, OpenTelemetry) | ✅ Customer RBAC on Azure resources | ✅ Customer deletes threads/files in own storage |
| **M365 Agents SDK** | ✅ Custom (developer implements) | ⚠️ Custom (developer implements thread storage) | ⚠️ Custom (Application Insights, custom logging) | ⚠️ Custom (developer implements) | ⚠️ Custom (developer implements) |

**Key Compliance Questions:**

- **Where is conversation history stored?** → M365 Copilot (user mailbox/Purview, plus user-level memory), Copilot Studio (Dataverse), Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (customer Cosmos DB), SDK (customer datastore)
- **How long is it retained?** → M365 Copilot (Purview retention or user deletion), Copilot Studio (policy configurable, 30-day default), Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (customer-defined lifecycle), SDK (custom)
- **Who can query chat logs?** → M365 Copilot (admins via eDiscovery, users see activity history), Copilot Studio (admins with Transcript Viewer role), Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (Azure RBAC), SDK (custom controls)
- **Can we scrub PII?** → Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (customer deletes in Cosmos/Storage), Studio (bulk delete transcripts), M365 Copilot (user clears activity history, Purview retention)
- **Can we run without saved transcripts?** → Teams calling "Only during the call" mode keeps speech-to-text transient; Copilot Studio toggle stops Dataverse saving.

| **Moderate (Task Execution)** | Multi-turn, 1-5 actions, simple branching | Declarative Agents with API plugins, Microsoft Foundry Agent Service |
| **Complex (Workflows)** | Sequential workflows, conditional logic | Declarative Agents + Power Automate, Agent Framework workflows |
| **Advanced (Multi-Agent)** | Agent-to-agent delegation, parallel execution | Copilot Studio multi-agent, Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, Agent Framework |
| **Expert (Custom Reasoning)** | Custom orchestration logic, model selection | Custom engine agents with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, Teams AI Library, or Microsoft Foundry Agent Service |

|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Data Residency** | M365 tenant region | Azure region selection |
| **Identity Management** | Entra ID (automatic) | Entra ID + Azure RBAC |
| **Approval Workflows** | M365 admin center (Integrated Apps) | Azure custom workflows |
| **Audit Logging** | Purview + M365 audit logs | Azure Monitor + Log Analytics |
| **Data Classification** | Purview DLP policies | Azure Policy + custom tagging |
| **AI Governance** | Microsoft Purview AI protections (DLP, compliance, audit) | Microsoft Foundry control plane + Azure Policy |
| **Deployment Control** | IT admin approval (tenant-wide settings) | Azure DevOps, CI/CD pipelines |
| **Real-Time Meeting/Call Transcripts** | Teams calling policy can enforce "Only during the call" to avoid post-call storage | Build ephemeral transcript handling or disable logging in custom stack |

{: .note }
**Copilot Studio compliance snapshot:** Covered under HIPAA BAA, HITRUST CSF, FedRAMP High, SOC, ISO 9001/20000-1/22301/27001/27017/27018/27701, PCI DSS, CSA STAR, UK G-Cloud, OSPAR, K-ISMS, Singapore MTCS Level 3, and Spain ENS High (audit artifacts via the Microsoft Service Trust Portal).
