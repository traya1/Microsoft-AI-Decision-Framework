| **$2K-$10K/mo** | Medium | Azure services | Azure AI Foundry, M365 SDK |
| **$10K+/mo** | High | Enterprise scale | Full Azure AI stack |

---

### Time to Production

| Timeline | Feasibility | Approach | Tradeoffs |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Days** | Simple only | M365 + Graph Connectors | Limited customization |
| **1-2 Weeks** | Low-code | Copilot Studio templates | Medium customization |
| **1-2 Months** | Custom agents | Studio + custom actions | Good balance |
| **3-6 Months** | Complex | Azure AI Foundry | Full customization |

---

### Governance & Compliance

| Level | Constraints | Approach | Why |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----|
| **High** | M365 tenant boundary only, strict DLP, no training on data | M365 Copilot | M365 trust boundary, strictest governance |
| **Medium-High** | Data sovereignty, RBAC, external connector controls, gateway for private access | Copilot Studio + DLP | Configurable, **external connectors inherit compliance** |
| **High (Azure)** | VNet isolation, private endpoints, CMK, no public egress | Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service | Azure landing zone controls, sovereign data |
| **High (Custom)** | Self-hosted, custom VNet, air-gapped support | M365 Agents SDK | Customer controls all networking |
| **Low** | Minimal, hosting platform dependent | Agent Framework | Maximum flexibility |

**Critical Considerations - Data Boundary:**
- **M365 Copilot:** Data NEVER leaves M365 tenant boundary. No training on tenant data. Inherits M365 compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP).
- **Copilot Studio:** ⚠️ External connectors (custom APIs, non-Microsoft systems) **inherit external system's compliance posture**. Web search leaves enterprise boundary (NOT covered by DPA). Compliance certifications: HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC, ISO, PCI DSS. Power Platform DLP policies (environment/tenant-level) control connector access, custom connector endpoints (pattern matching), autonomous agent triggers.
- **Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service:** Full Azure controls (VNet, private endpoints, CMK, Azure Policy). Governed by YOUR Azure landing zone. Content Safety service provides configurable filtering (Hate, Violence, Sexual, Self-Harm at Low/Medium/High severity), groundedness detection, prompt shields (jailbreak/indirect attacks).

**Critical Considerations - Network Isolation:**
- **Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service:** ✅ Full private networking support. Standard Setup with Private Networking = no public egress by default. Supports air-gapped environments.
- **Copilot Studio:** ⚠️ Does NOT execute in customer VNet. Requires on-premises data gateway (for on-prem systems) OR VNet data gateway (GA, for Azure resources). Not suitable for fully air-gapped without gateway setup.
- **M365 Agents SDK:** ✅ Self-hosted = customer controls networking. Supports VNet integration, private endpoints, air-gapped Azure deployments. Full responsibility for network security.
- **M365 Copilot:** ❌ No custom VNet support (fully managed SaaS). Requires gateway architecture for on-prem data access.

**Critical Considerations - Permissions & Identity Model:**
- **M365 Copilot:** ✅ Always user-scoped. "It only sees what I can see" = TRUE (architecturally guaranteed). Actions attributed to individual users.
- **Copilot Studio:** ⚠️ Dual auth mode: User authentication (user-scoped) OR Agent author authentication (service account). Service accounts can exceed individual user permissions. **Critical for actions that write data.**
- **Azure AI Foundry:** ⚠️ API key (bypasses user identity) OR Entra ID (per-user RBAC, managed identities). **Entra ID recommended for production** (user attribution, least privilege).
- **M365 Agents SDK:** ⚠️ Custom auth design: Delegated permissions (user-scoped) OR Application permissions (service principal, tenant-wide scope). **Requires documented auth architecture for audit.**

### Action Safety & Content Safety
{: .no_toc }

**Key considerations:**
- **M365 Copilot:** ✅ User-in-the-loop always (drafts only, user executes). Cannot take destructive actions. ✅ Content moderation + prompt injection defenses built-in.
- **Copilot Studio:** ⚠️ Actions can execute (Power Automate flows, custom connectors). No built-in human approval. **Add approval workflows for destructive actions.** ✅ Content moderation blocks malicious prompts.
- **Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service:** ⚠️ Tool calling with autonomous planning loops. No built-in approval. **Implement human-in-the-loop + OpenTelemetry tracing.** ✅ Content safety via Azure AI Content Safety service.
- **M365 Agents SDK:** ⚠️ Custom design (developer responsibility). No built-in action safety or approval. **Implement custom guardrails.** Content safety depends on implementation.

#### Action Safety Guardrail Playbook
{: #action-safety-guardrail-playbook .no_toc }

**Why it matters:** These controls operationalize the Action Safety score. Use them to design approval checkpoints, logging, and escalation workflows before promoting an agent to production.

**Guardrail Workflow:**
1. **Classify actions by risk** (read-only, write, destructive) and document examples.
2. **Decide approval paths** for medium/high risk actions (manager approval, security desk, or service owner).
3. **Enforce boundaries** by limiting which tools can execute autonomously and which require explicit human confirmation.
4. **Monitor and trace** every execution (OpenTelemetry, Purview, Application Insights) so auditors can reconstruct the decision path.

**Action Risk Classification**

| Risk Level | Examples | Approval Required | Recommended Treatment |
|------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Low (Read)** | Search, lookup, reporting | No | Allow automatically; log only |
| **Medium (Write)** | Create record, update status, send notification | Optional | Approval or post-execution review in regulated domains |
| **High (Destructive)** | Delete, disable, approve spend, security changes | Yes | Always require human-in-the-loop before execution |

**Guardrails by Platform**

**M365 Copilot (built-in experiences)**
- User always executes the final action; drafts remain user-scoped. No extra guardrails required beyond Purview auditing.
- Reference: [Microsoft 365 Copilot security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-ai-security) (Updated: 2024-10-10)

**Copilot Studio (SaaS)**
- Add **Start and wait for an approval** inside Power Automate flows before any destructive action.
- Validate parameters with condition blocks (e.g., amount thresholds) and environment-level DLP policies.
- Enable Dataverse audit logs so transcripts/actions are reviewable by compliance teams.
- Reference: [Business applications integrations with Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-business-applications) (Updated: 2024-10-05)

**Azure AI Foundry / Agent Service (PaaS)**
- Implement human-in-the-loop middleware for high-risk tool calls; store approvals in durable storage.
- Use OpenTelemetry tracing and Azure Monitor to capture full tool execution chains.
- Apply Azure Policy/API Management allowlists so agents can only call approved endpoints.
- Reference: [Azure AI Agent Service transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/agents/transparency-note) (Updated: 2024-10-15)

**M365 Agents SDK (custom code)**
- Build explicit approval middleware that routes destructive actions to a reviewer before execution.
- Classify actions in code (read/write/destructive) and enforce deny-by-default for destructive categories.
- Log every action with initiating user identity via Application Insights or custom telemetry.
- Reference: [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/security) (Updated: 2024-10-22)

**Architecture Recipes**

- **Approval Workflow (Power Automate):** `User Request → Agent Plans Action → [If Destructive] → Trigger Approval Flow → Manager Approves/Rejects → Execute or Cancel`
- **Human-in-the-Loop Middleware (custom code):**
    ```typescript
    async function executeToolWithApproval(toolName: string, params: any) {
      if (isDestructive(toolName)) {
        const approval = await requestHumanApproval(toolName, params);
        if (!approval.approved) {
          return { error: "Action rejected by reviewer" };
        }
      }
      return await executeTool(toolName, params);
    }
    ```
- **Read-Only Core with Delegated Execution:** `Agent → Generates plan → Presents to user → User clicks "Execute" → Authenticated API call runs under user's identity`

**Action Safety Decision Matrix**

| Technology | Built-in Safety | Approval Mechanism | Tracing | Best For |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| **M365 Copilot** | ✅ User-in-the-loop | N/A (draft drafts only) | Purview audit logs | Maximum safety |
| **Copilot Studio** | ⚠️ Actions can execute | Power Automate approvals | Dataverse audit logs | Low-code with approvals |
| **Azure AI Foundry / Agent Service** | ⚠️ Autonomous execution | Custom middleware | OpenTelemetry, Azure Monitor | Pro-code with tracing |
| **M365 Agents SDK** | ❌ Custom design | Custom implementation | Custom telemetry | Full custom control |

> **Documentation tip:** capture the guardrail decisions in your change log so audit reviewers know why specific approvals and rate limits exist.

**Critical Considerations - Proactive Capabilities (Question 9):**

- **Reactive only:** M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio declarative agents (user-initiated interactions only).[^m365reactive-ec][^copilotstudioevent-ec]
- **Proactive capable:** Copilot Studio custom engine agents (Power Automate triggers), Logic Apps (event-driven), Azure AI Foundry (Functions/triggers), M365 Agents SDK (custom event listeners).[^copilotstudioevent-ec][^logicappstrigger-ec][^agentservicega-ec][^agentssdk-ec]

### Memory, Analytics & Conversation History

**Question for Legal/Audit Teams:**

Understanding where conversation data is stored and who can access it is **critical** for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal).

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Where is conversation history stored?
- How long is it retained?
- Who can access it?
- Can we scrub PII from transcripts?
- Does this meet our compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX)?

**Technology Comparison:** See [Quick Reference - Memory & Analytics]({{ '/docs/quick-reference#memory--analytics-by-technology' | relative_url }}) for detailed comparison table.

**Critical Distinctions:**
- **M365 Copilot:** Grounding ONLY (NO per-user memory extractable by admins). Activity history in user mailbox (Purview-governed).
- **Copilot Studio:** Grounding + Dataverse memory variables. Full transcript access for admins (critical for regulated review).
- **Azure AI Agent Service:** BYO thread storage (customer Cosmos DB). Customer responsible for retention, PII scrubbing.
- **M365 Agents SDK:** Custom implementation (developer implements everything).

- Prefer managed infrastructure (SaaS convenience)
- Response times <1s are acceptable
- Built-in governance and ALM are priorities
- Team includes makers and developers
- **Testing:** [Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/kit-overview) for automated agent validation (response match, topic match, generative answers, multi-turn scenarios)

**Choose Azure AI Foundry when:**

- Latency <100ms is required (real-time applications)
- Need full architectural control and optimization
- High-throughput scenarios (PTU provisioning)
- **Testing:** [Prompt flow evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/evaluate-generative-ai-app) with built-in metrics (groundedness, relevance, coherence) or custom evaluators
- Custom patterns beyond platform capabilities
- Custom integrations outside standard connector ecosystem
- Team has Azure and AI engineering expertise
- Pair with the AG-UI protocol (Preview) when you need SSE streaming, shared state, or human approvals surfaced directly in custom web or mobile clients.[^agui-eval]

**Complementary Use:**

Many organizations use both platforms - Copilot Studio for rapid deployment with rich connector integration, Azure AI Foundry for performance-critical custom applications. The platforms serve complementary needs, not competitive choices.

#### Scale Planning by User Volume
{: .no_toc }

| Scale | Users | Requests/Day | Copilot Studio Fit | Azure AI Foundry Fit |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Small** | <100 | <1K | ✅ Ideal (rapid deployment) | ⚠️ May be over-engineered |
| **Medium** | 100-1K | 1K-50K | ✅ Strong (with capacity planning) | ✅ Strong (with cost optimization) |
| **Large** | 1K-10K | 50K-500K | ⚠️ Monitor quotas carefully | ✅ Ideal (PTU provisioning) |
| **Enterprise** | 10K+ | 500K+ | ⚠️ Requires premium capacity | ✅ Ideal (enterprise scale) |

#### Rate Limits & Cost Model Trade-Offs
{: .no_toc }

**Copilot Studio:**

- **Environment-level quotas:**
  - General messages: 8,000 requests per minute (RPM) per Dataverse environment
  - Generative AI: 50-100+ RPM / 1,000-2,000+ requests per hour (RPH) (scales with capacity packs: 50 RPM/1K RPH for 1-10 packs, up to 100 RPM/2K RPH for 51+ packs or PAYG)
- **Shared across agents:** All agents in environment share quota pool
- **Channel limits:** Channels include Teams, Web (Direct Line), Mobile, WhatsApp, Facebook, Azure Bot Service channels
- **Power Platform requests:** 250K/24h for standard subscription (flows triggered by agents)
- **Cost predictability:** Prepaid packs or PAYG ($0.01/Copilot Credit)
- **Increase limits:** Contact Support for rate limit increases (PAYG environments only)
- **Best for:** Predictable workloads, call centers, internal use cases with capacity planning

**Azure AI Foundry / Agent Service:**
