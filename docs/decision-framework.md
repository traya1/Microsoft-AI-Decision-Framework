## Phase 1: Business Impact Assessment (BXT Framework)

Before evaluating technology options, validate the use case through three dimensions. **All three must score medium-high to proceed.**

### 1. Viability (Business)
{: .no_toc }

- ROI beyond general productivity gains?
- Quantifiable cost savings or revenue increase?
- Strategic alignment?
- TCO vs. benefit analysis?

### 2. Desirability (Experience)
{: .no_toc }

- Motivating reason to use over current alternative?
- Solves painful, frequent problem?
- Measurable adoption?
- Natural workflow fit?

### 3. Feasibility (Technology)
{: .no_toc }

- Current team skillsets?
- Hire/train/partner decisions?
- Data accessible & governable?
- Infrastructure and compliance ready?

### Decision Gate
{: .no_toc }

- ❌ **Any dimension scores low** → Revisit use case, defer project, or move to "Research/Incubate" quadrant
- ✅ **All dimensions score medium-high** → Proceed to Phase 2 (Technology Selection)

---

## Phase 2: Technology Groupings (Nine Critical Questions)

Apply these questions **sequentially** after passing the BXT assessment. Each question creates **technology groupings** rather than jumping to specific recommendations. The groupings feed into Phase 3 for final selection.

💡 **Important:** These questions create buckets/categories. Final technology selection happens in **Phase 3** based on scenario-specific criteria (time-to-market, complexity, budget, etc.).

---

### Question 1: User Experience Location
{: .no_toc }

Identify the primary place people will engage with the agent. The interaction surface immediately narrows the candidate technologies.

- **M365 apps** (Teams, Outlook, Word) → Stay inside the Microsoft 365 trust boundary with built-in agents, Copilot Studio M365 channels, or Graph connectors.
- **Custom or multi-channel** (web, mobile, SMS, email) → Use M365 Agents SDK, Azure AI Foundry, or Logic Apps to reach every endpoint consistently. Pair Agent Framework with the AG-UI protocol when you need streaming UI, shared state, or human-in-the-loop approvals in bespoke web/mobile experiences.[^agui-overview]
- **API/headless** workloads → Design for services that call the agent as a capability rather than a UI.

📎 Use the groupings from this question with the layer mappings in [Five-Layer Capability Model]({{ '/docs/capability-model' | relative_url }}) and the examples in [Scenarios]({{ '/docs/scenarios' | relative_url }}).

---

### Question 2: Build Style & Control Level
{: .no_toc }

Decide how much engineering control you need versus how fast you must ship.

- **Low-code / managed** – Copilot Studio, AI Builder, declarative agents. Makers and developers can deliver in days when declarative orchestration is enough.
- **Pro-code / customizable** – M365 Agents SDK, Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft Agent Framework, AG-UI protocol (Preview), Teams AI Library. Full control over orchestration, hosting, and integrations while surfacing agents in any UI channel.[^agui-overview]
- **Hybrid** – Start in Copilot Studio for speed, bring in Azure AI Foundry or Agent Framework when custom logic or private hosting is required.

🧭 For side-by-side capabilities, see the development approach matrices in [Quick Reference]({{ '/docs/quick-reference' | relative_url }}) and [Technologies]({{ '/docs/technologies' | relative_url }}).

---

### Question 3: Data Grounding Pattern
{: .no_toc }

Separate how you ground answers from how you persist history or analytics.

- **Grounding (RAG)** – Retrieve the right files or records per request (Microsoft Graph, Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2025). Standard agent setup provisions customer-owned Azure Storage, Azure AI Search, and Cosmos DB containers for thread data.[^standardsetup]
- **Memory** – Decide if conversations should persist (Copilot Studio Dataverse variables, Azure AI Agent Service thread stores, custom implementations).
- **Analytics** – Plan transcript retention, telemetry, and review processes before launch.

🧩 See [Implementation Patterns]({{ '/docs/implementation-patterns#pattern-3-microsoft-365-knowledge-grounding' | relative_url }}) for ingestion blueprints and [Evaluation Criteria]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#6-memory-analytics--conversation-history' | relative_url }}) for scoring considerations.

---

### Question 4: Orchestration Complexity
{: .no_toc }

Match orchestration tooling to conversation and workflow depth.

- **Simple Q&A** – Declarative agents, Copilot Studio’s generative orchestration, built-in M365 Copilot experiences.
- **Deterministic workflows** – Copilot Studio Agent Flows, Azure Logic Apps, or Agent Framework workflows when you need checkpoints or human approval steps.
- **Multi-agent or custom logic** – Azure AI Agent Service connected agents, Agent Framework, or custom engines via M365 Agents SDK when collaboration or advanced reasoning is required.

🧠 The orchestration comparison tables in [Feature Comparison]({{ '/docs/feature-comparison' | relative_url }}) highlight the trade-offs.

---

### Question 5: Compliance & Trust Boundary
{: .no_toc }

Answer “Where does my data go, and who can act on it?” before choosing a platform.

- **M365 trust boundary** – Prompts, responses, and Graph data remain inside Microsoft 365; best for regulated organizations needing tenant guarantees.
- **Power Platform boundary** – Copilot Studio keeps core data in-region but inherits the compliance posture of every connector you call and sends web search queries to Bing consumer services.[^transcriptcontrols][^copilotcalls]
- **Azure landing zone** – Azure AI Foundry and Agent Service adopt your subscription’s network, identity, and policy controls, with private networking and customer-managed keys available by design.
- **Hybrid approaches** – Mix declarative and custom agents, or route everything through Azure API Management for centralized policy enforcement.

🔐 Detailed matrices for network isolation, identity, and governance live in [Technologies]({{ '/docs/technologies#network-isolation-capabilities' | relative_url }}) and [Evaluation Criteria]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#governance--compliance' | relative_url }}).

---

### Question 6: Scale and Cost Requirements
{: .no_toc }

Model the usage pattern and budget envelope early so you can select the right consumption model.

- **Predictable spend** – M365 Copilot per-user licensing or Copilot Studio prepaid capacity packs.
- **Variable spend with guardrails** – Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service pay-per-token, Copilot Studio PAYG metering, with rate limits and budget alerts to control spikes.
- **Custom throttling** – M365 Agents SDK or Agent Framework solutions where you own auto-scaling and rate limiting.

📊 See [Evaluation Criteria]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#scale--performance' | relative_url }}) for capacity planning guidance and [Technologies]({{ '/docs/technologies' | relative_url }}) for service-specific quota references.

---

### Question 7: Can the Agent Take Destructive Actions?
{: .no_toc }

Clarify action safety expectations and determine whether humans must remain in the loop.

- **Draft-only** – M365 Copilot keeps humans in control and logs activity automatically.[^m365admin]
- **Configurable execution** – Copilot Studio can call flows or APIs, so design approval steps and audit coverage explicitly.[^agentflows][^humanreview]
- **Autonomous execution** – Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service (tool calling, OpenTelemetry tracing) and M365 Agents SDK (custom guardrails) enable full automation, but only when you provide your own safety framework.[^aifoundrytrace][^agentssdk]

🛡️ Use the [Action Safety Guardrail Playbook]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#action-safety-guardrail-playbook' | relative_url }}) for guardrail recipes and [Evaluation Criteria]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#action-safety--content-safety' | relative_url }}) to score risk.

---

### Question 8: Team Skills & Ownership
{: .no_toc }

Select a platform your organization can build and sustain.

- **Makers / fusion teams** – Copilot Studio, AI Builder, Power Platform templates.[^copilotstudio][^aibuilderoverview]
- **Professional developers** – M365 Agents SDK, Azure AI Foundry, Agent Framework, Teams AI Library, with full CI/CD ownership.[^declarativecomparison][^agentstoolkitoverview][^foundryoverview]
- **AI/ML engineers** – Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning for custom models and evaluations.[^aiarchitecture]
- **Integration architects** – Logic Apps, API Management, Power Automate for enterprise workflows and connector governance.[^logicappsoverview]

📚 The skills matrix in [Evaluation Criteria]({{ '/docs/evaluation-criteria#skills--resources' | relative_url }}) keeps the decision evidence-based.

---

### Question 9: Does the Agent Need to Initiate Actions?
{: .no_toc }

Determine whether the agent is purely reactive or must trigger events on its own.

- **Reactive only** – M365 Copilot and Copilot Studio declarative agents wait for a user prompt before doing anything.[^m365reactive][^copilotstudioevent]
- **Proactive capable** – Copilot Studio custom engine agents (Power Automate triggers), Azure Logic Apps, Azure AI Foundry/Agent Service integrations, and M365 Agents SDK listeners can respond to schedules, webhooks, or system alerts.[^logicappstrigger][^agentservicega]

⚙️ Use the automation sections in [Implementation Patterns]({{ '/docs/implementation-patterns#pattern-4-multi-channel-custom-engine-agent' | relative_url }}) to blueprint event-driven designs.
